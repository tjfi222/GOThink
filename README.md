# GOThink
GO library for basic neural networks. 

This repository includes the main packages used for a simple neural network implementation. This code was originally written as a way of learning the GO programming language, as well as the raw implemenation of neural network computations. This code was soley developed by myself (Troy Fields) without the use of any external libraries. There are many features I would like to add, including the implementation of goroutines to take advantage of concurrency. 

The repository includes the following main packages:

* Neuron
* Layer
* Network
* Trainer
* Prep

In addition, the "big.go" file illustrates how to use the library on the MINST dataset (also included in this repository).
